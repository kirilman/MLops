# From Airflow 3.0.2, the `dags` folder (a.k.a. the DagBundle) is no longer automatically included on the PYTHONPATH
# This means that in order to use our custom Python modules, we need to install the custom directory. We also
# added a small `setup.py` to make this work, as well as volume mounts in the compose override.
